# Hi

I'm Jae Park, a passionate programmer who loves to work on projects. In particular, I love working with data and ML/AI, but also enjoy working on other things like backend development. My main language is Python, but I am also fluent in Javascript. I hope to leverage the power of technology to make an impact in the world. 

# About me
